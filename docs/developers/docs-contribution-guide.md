# Contributing to Korpi Engine Documentation

## How can I contribute to the docs?

First, you should read the [Code Contribution Guide](code-contribution-guide.md), as the process is very similar.

Second, please contact me (Japsu) on the [Korpi Discord](https://discord.gg/AhSX58wmWG) or [open an issue](https://github.com/japsuu/KorpiEngine/issues/new/choose) before starting work on any documentation changes, to avoid duplicate work.
Please state that you would like to work on the documentation in your message.

Once your issue has been approved, you can start working on your changes. When you're done, open a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main repository's `main` branch.
