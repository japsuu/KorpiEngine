# Korpi Engine

Korpi Engine is an open source 3D game-engine written in C# and OpenGL, that I use to build some of my personal projects.

> The engine is still under development and is not yet feature-complete.

## Project goals

The long-term goal of this project is to eventually develop into its own engine with Unity-like API, capable of handling a wide variety of 3D games.
The engine is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy integration of new features and systems.

## Personal goals

My main goal with this project is to get familiar with OpenGL and the ins and outs of engine/tool development.

## Project status

[Basic usage example](src/KorpiEngine.Runtime/Sandbox/CustomScene.cs) is included in the `Sandbox` directory, inside the `KorpiEngine.Runtime` project. This example demonstrates how to create a simple scene with a rotating/moving quad.
